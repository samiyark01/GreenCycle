# GreenCycle 

**Turn your e-waste into a positive environmental impact.**

GreenCycle is a web platform built with Django that helps people manage their
electronic waste in a responsible and eco-friendly way.  
Instead of letting old electronics pile up or end up in landfills, users can
schedule pickups, track recycling status, and contribute to a cleaner future.

## Why GreenCycle?

Electronic waste is increasing rapidly, but most people don’t know how or where
to dispose of it safely. GreenCycle solves this problem by providing a simple,
transparent, and reliable platform for e-waste recycling.

This project focuses on **real-world usability**, **clear workflows**, and
**sustainable impact**.
